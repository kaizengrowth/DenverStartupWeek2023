# Instructions

## Part 1. Setup

1. Sign up for a free account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup) if you do not yet have one.
    * GitHub is like a public workspace for software engineers to save different versions of their code, and share / collaborate with others.
<br/>

2. Sign up for a free Hobby account on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup) if you do not yet have one, and link this to your GitHub account.
    * Vercel is a cloud hosting platform that helps software engineers showcase their applications, display efficiently to global users, while automatically updating any changes to code in GitHub.
    * Vercel has built-in support for [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/docs), the full stack web development framework we are using.
    * Once you've created your account, in your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new), import your git repositories by clicking on "Import." Under Importing Git Repository, select "Add Github Account." This will open up a new "Install Vercel" window in Github.com. Click on the green "Install" button to link your Github account to Vercel.
<br/>

3. Sign up for an account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch). Create an API key for your account [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). All new users get free $5 worth of tokens to use the OpenAI API. This is more than sufficient for powering our project.
<br/>

4. Download the appropriate version of this code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for your operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux.
