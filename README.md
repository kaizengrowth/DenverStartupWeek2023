# Instructions

## Part 1. Setup

1. Sign up for a free account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/signup) if you do not yet have one.
    * GitHub is like a public workspace for software engineers to save different versions of their code, and share / collaborate with others.
<br/>

2. Sign up for a free Hobby account on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup) if you do not yet have one, and link this to your GitHub account.
    * Vercel is a cloud hosting platform that helps software engineers showcase their applications, display efficiently to global users, while automatically updating any changes to code in GitHub.
    * Vercel has built-in support for [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/docs), the full stack web development framework we are using.
    * Once you've created your account, in your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new), import your git repositories by clicking on "Import." Under Importing Git Repository, select "Add Github Account." This will open up a new "Install Vercel" window in Github.com. Click on the green "Install" button to link your Github account to Vercel.

3. Sign up for an account on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup?launch). Create an API key for your account [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). All new users get free $5 worth of tokens to use the OpenAI API. This is more than sufficient for powering our project.
<br/>

4. Download the appropriate version of this code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), for your operating system: Windows, Mac or Linux.

## Part 2. Deploy the Vercel AI Template

5. Take a look at the following [AI app templates and examples at Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/ai). All of these are free for you to modify and use, with one-click deployment on Vercel.
    * Scroll down to the [AI Twitter Bio Generator](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/twitter-bio) by open source software contributor Hassan el Mghari.
    * Click on the white [Deploy](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Generate%20your%20Twitter%20bio%20with%20OpenAI%20GPT-3%20API%20(text-davinci-003)%20and%20Vercel%20Edge%20Functions%20with%20streaming.&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F2I7NoGPw25Em00dQYxMdJg%2Fba571bc9c9334611ebe4c67973029c26%2Fscreenshot.png&demo-title=AI%20Twitter%20Bio%20Generator&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitterbio.io&env=OPENAI_API_KEY&envDescription=Get%20your%20API%20key%20from%20Openai.com&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fbeta.openai.com%2Faccount%2Fapi-keys&from=templates&project-name=AI%20Twitter%20Bio%20Generator&repository-name=twitter-bio&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNutlope%2Ftwitterbio&skippable-integrations=1) button.
    * You'll see a page that says "You're almost done." In the box on the right, under the heading "Create Git Repository", select your GitHub username and name this repository "startup-week-demo".

<br/>

6. You will be asked to "Configure Project" with your OpenAI_API_Key.

For now, just type in the following string in the input box called "Value (Will Be Encrypted)`"temporarystring123"`, and click on the "Deploy" button
    * __NOTE:__ You can type in any random string you wish. Your actual key will be entered later into the '.env' file in your repository.
    * The deployment process will take a little time to run. No worries! Vercel handles most of the difficult parts for you, so this part is a little like magic.

<br/>

7. When you're done with deployment, you'll see a page that says "Congratulations! You just deployed a new Project to Vercel." Click on the button to "Continue to Dashboard."

<br/>

8. In your Project Dashboard, you will see the name of the project, and three buttons to the right of the name:
    * The "Git Repository" button will lead you to where your code is stored on GitHub.
    * The "Visit" button will lead you to where your application is currently deployed onto the cloud for everyone in the world to see.
    * Click on the "Git Repository" button to open up your code repository in GitHub. Also "Visit" your new application!
